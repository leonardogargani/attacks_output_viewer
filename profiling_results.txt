Here are some useful measurements about execution time and memory usage of the program.

All the tests have been performed on a machine with an i7-7500U (dual-core @ 2.70 GHz) CPU and 8 GB of RAM.

The 16 CSV files, each one with 256 columns and ~35k rows, are converted to NPY files.

    - execution time: 1m55s
    - memory usage: 1.1 GB

peak_detection.py
    - execution time: 2m10s

        - each new plot:
            - loading the .npy file: 65 MB
            - window creation: 5 MB
            - each displayed line: 1 MB
